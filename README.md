## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Basic JavaScript 

### What I learned

In this project I mainly focused on practice rather than learning something completely new.  
It was a good chance to refresh and recall some basic concepts:


- Structuring a small project with semantic HTML and clean CSS.
- Using CSS custom properties for consistent styling.
- Implementing a simple accordion interaction with JavaScript (`max-height` + `opacity` transition).
- Practicing responsive design (desktop â†’ mobile).

This challenge was more about building confidence with the basics and completing a full workflow from coding to deployment.
